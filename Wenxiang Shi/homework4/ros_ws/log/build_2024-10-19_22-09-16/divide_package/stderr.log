[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:15 (find_package):
  By not providing "Finddivide_interfaces.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "divide_interfaces", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "divide_interfaces"
  with any of the following names:

    divide_interfacesConfig.cmake
    divide_interfaces-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "divide_interfaces" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or
  set "divide_interfaces_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above
  files.  If "divide_interfaces" provides a separate development package or
  SDK, be sure it has been installed.
